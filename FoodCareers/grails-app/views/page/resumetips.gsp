        <h1>Resume Tips</h1>
<p>Below you will find a sample of a resume format that we have found to be successful.  You can customize it to your own needs or the specific requirements of the position.  Add additional sections as necessary (Publications, Patents, etc.).</p>
<p>To help you construct a more effective, higher impact resume, here are some overall considerations in regard to your resume’s content and presentation.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity of Dates and Locations</strong> – Document your work history and educational credentials accurately.  Do not leave the reader guessing where and when you have been employed, or when you earned your degree.  Make sure the dates are clear and without gaps.  </li>
<li><strong>Detail</strong> – Specify some of the more technical, or specialized aspects of your past work or training, especially if you have performed tasks of any complexity, or significance to your product area of expertise.  Balance your resume with your own personal accomplishments and accomplishments you achieved through others.  Technical accomplishments and leadership need to be obvious to any reader.</li>
<li><strong>Explicitness</strong> – Let the reader know the nature, size and location of your past employers.  Identify your former employers’ specific business and/or product line.</li>
<li><strong>Font and Font Size</strong> – Only use sans-serif fonts such as Arial. These fonts clearly separate each letter from the next. The font size should be 11 or 12.</li>
<li><strong>Length</strong> – The general rule is one page for early-career (entry level to 5 years) and two pages for mid-career (5-20 years) candidates.  Three pages is justified if your industry experience is 20 years or more.</li>
<li><strong>Spelling, Grammar, Punctuation, and Consistency</strong> – Create an error-free document that is representative of an educated professional.  Remember, first impressions are often lasting impressions.  Using bullet point format allows you to use phrases to describe your accomplishments and are less likely to contain grammatical errors.</li>
<li><strong>Military History</strong> – If you served in the armed forces, describe your length of service, specific dates, branch of service, rank, special training, medals, and discharge and/or reserve status.  Employers generally react favorable to military service experience.</li>
<li><strong>Citizenship or Residency Status</strong> – This should be mentioned if your current residency status offers certain challenges for future US employment.</li>
<li><strong>References</strong> - As a rule, it is not necessary to include references on your resume unless the employer specifically requests them.  We ask that they be submitted to us as a separate document.</li>
</ul>
